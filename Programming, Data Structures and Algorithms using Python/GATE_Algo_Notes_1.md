# NPTEL: Programming, Data Structures & Algorithms using Python

Notes from the introductory lecture on Algorithms.

## 1. What is an Algorithm? üìù

- An **algorithm** is a systematic method for performing a task, written down as a sequence of steps.
- It can be thought of as a **recipe** or a **program**.
- Our focus is on algorithms that **manipulate information**.

---

## 2. Types of Algorithms (Examples)

- **Computing numerical functions:** e.g., calculating `$f(x,y) = x^y$`.
- **Reorganizing data:** e.g., arranging a list of numbers in ascending order.
- **Optimization:** e.g., finding the shortest route between two points.
- **Problem Solving:** e.g., solving a Sudoku puzzle.

## 3. Example: Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

### Definition

`gcd(m,n)` is the **largest integer `k`** that divides both `m` and `n`.
  - **Example 1:** `gcd(8,12) = 4`
  - **Example 2:** `gcd(18,25) = 1` (Their only common divisor is 1).

### A Simple Algorithm for `gcd(m,n)` (Method 1: Listing Factors)

This method is straightforward but not the most efficient.

1.  List all factors of `m` (numbers from 1 to `m` that divide `m`).
2.  List all factors of `n` (numbers from 1 to `n` that divide `n`).
3.  Create a new list of common factors that appear in both of the above lists.
4.  The `gcd` is the **largest number** in this new list of common factors.

### Walkthrough: `gcd(14, 63)`

-   Factors of 14: `{1, 2, 7, 14}`
-   Factors of 63: `{1, 3, 7, 21, 63}`
-   Common Factors: `{1, 7}`
-   Largest Common Factor: **7**

## 4. Python Implementation of the "Listing Factors" GCD Algorithm

This code implements the exact steps described above.

```python
def gcd(m, n):
  """
  Computes the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers m and n
  by listing all factors.
  """
  # 1. Find factors of m
  fm = []
  for i in range(1, m + 1):
    if (m % i) == 0:
      fm.append(i)

  # 2. Find factors of n
  fn = []
  for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if (n % j) == 0:
      fn.append(j)

  # 3. Find common factors
  cf = []
  for f in fm:
    if f in fn:
      cf.append(f)

  # 4. Return the largest common factor
  return cf[-1]
